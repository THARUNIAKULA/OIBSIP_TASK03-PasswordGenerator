Project Idea :- Random Password Generator

Project Description :-
○ Creating a password generator in Python that generates random passwords based on user-defined criteria, such as length and character types (letters, numbers, symbols).
○ Allows users to specify password length and character set preferences.
○ Develop an advanced password generator with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter or PyQt.
○ Enhance it by including options for password complexity

Key Concepts and Challenges Satisfied:-

○ Randomization: Learn how to generate random characters and strings.
○ User Input Validation: Validate user input for password length and character types.
○ Character Set Handling: Manage different character sets (letters, numbers, symbols).
○ GUI Design: Create an intuitive and user-friendly interface for password generation.
○ Security Rules: Implement rules for generating strong, secure passwords.
○ Customization: Enable users to customize password generation further, e.g., excluding specific characters.
